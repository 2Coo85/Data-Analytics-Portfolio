        <h1>Capstone: NFL Offensive Trends 2004-2019</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Summary of Project</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this analysis is to examine what makes an NFL player and team productive by looking at NFL datasets that span from 2004-2019. The two datasets that used were the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present">NFL Player Data</a> from Kaggle and the <a href="https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data"> nflverse data repository</a> from GitHub.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Tools and Steps</h2>
            <p>The 5 datasets that were pulled from Kaggle were downloaded into Google Sheets and Excel where they were cleaned and re-formatted.</p>
            <p>Once the individual datasets were cleaned, they were uploaded into BigQuery to join the five tables together to create one table with the players, teams, and their stats. I also created secondary queries to create tables that looked at specific aspects of the data to answer the purpose of the analysis.</p>
            <p>Once I had created all the tables I needed, they were brought them into Excel to create a data source for my Tableau visualizations. I decided to create 4 visualizations: a bar graph and a heatmap that looked at player performance based on 'air' and 'ground' yards; and a bar graph and a combo plot grpah with trend line that looked at team performance based on plays and yards.</p>
            <p>After creating the visualizations, I brought in the combined dataset to do an analysis by using R programming.</p>

                <p>This analysis examined NFL offensive trends from 2004 to 2019, focusing on the balance between rushing and passing. Key findings include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Shift from Rushing to Passing</em>:  The early 2000s emphasized rushing, with running backs accumulating more yards and dominating the top player rankings (e.g., LaDainian Tomlinson, Frank Gore). However, a clear trend emerged towards passing offenses.  Average passing yards per game increased, while average rushing yards decreased.</li>
                    <li><em>Team Success vs. Individual Yardage Leaders</em>: Interestingly, the top five most successful teams during this period (including the New England Patriots) did not necessarily feature players who ranked high in individual yardage. This suggests that overall team strategy and performance may not always correlate directly with individual player statistics.</li>
                    <li><em>Implications for Team Management</em>:  These findings highlight the dynamic nature of NFL offenses.  While individual talent remains important, a successful team requires a well-balanced strategy that adapts to evolving league trends.  General managers should prioritize building a versatile roster and coaching staff capable of excelling in both rushing and passing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This analysis provides valuable insights into offensive trends in the NFL, emphasizing the shift towards passing and the complex relationship between individual player performance and team success.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>Beyond the top 5 teams, is there a stronger correlation between team success and individual player yardage when looking at a larger sample size?</em></li>
                    <li><em>What other factors, beyond individual yardage, contribute to team success in the NFL?</em> (e.g., coaching, turnovers, special teams play, player health).</li>
                    <li><em>Are there specific player positions or skillsets that have become more valuable in the passing era?</em></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Impact on Player Evaluation and Draft Strategies:</h3>
