        <ul>
            <li>Explored BigQuery’s public dataset on homelessness from 2010 - 2018 to draw insights into the trends</li>
            <li>Modified the dataset using SQL to allow for more efficient analysis, including removing columns and creating new columns</li>
            <li>Performed data analysis using SQL queries to identify locations that need support for homeless youth and homeless veterans, in addition to sourcing locations that were effectively supporting their homeless population</li>

            <p>We want to develop some new programs to help unaccompanied homeless children under 18 years old, and need some locations to start some programs. What are the top 3 Continuum of Care areas (CoC_Name in the table) with the highest number of unaccompanied homeless youth under 18 in the year 2018.</p>

            <p>2. We suspect that in Delaware (state abbreviation is “DE”), the number of unsheltered homeless people has been increasing over the past 7 years. Is this statement true? How do you know?</p>

            <p>Answer:
            This statement is true due to the fact that when we queried the number of unsheltered homeless people in Delaware, we saw that, outside of 2013, the numbers were steadily increasing over time.</p>
            
            <p>SQL Code Used:</p>
            <p>SELECT
              Count_Year,

            <p>3. The Safe Haven program was created in 1992 to provide shelter for people who are homeless and have a serious mental illness. However, funding for Safe Havens was cut in 2009, so no new Safe Havens could be created. Looking at data from only 2018, answer the following questions:</p>
            <p>In 2018, how many different locations had at least 1 person as a Sheltered_SH?</p>
