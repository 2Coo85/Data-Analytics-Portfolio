            <h4>About Me | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MINt7lbU_KKRvUpGtHMmHPAe57fh5KlOHby6NNU5Xpg/edit?usp=sharing">Resume</a></h4>
            <p>As an avid learner, I have enjoyed learning about many things including foreign languages and programming languages. I love how just a few lines of code can change a static site into a fun, interactive one. Through my education at Texas Tech, I learned that I was good at executing code and that I enjoyed researching topics that were interesting and could potentially help others by giving them knowledge they may not have had.</p>

            <p>Transitioning into a data analytics career is a strategic move in today's data-driven world. The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate is a solid step that will equip me with essential skills like SQL, Tableau, R programming, and data cleaning. I am enthusiastic to become a 'data detective' by securing an entry-level role and contributing to informed decision-making processes in any organization.</p>

            <p>Going from a customer service background to data analytics is a thrilling and rewarding step in my journey. Throughout my professional career, I have been dedicated to customer satisfaction and have developed a strong, positive work ethic. With my natural curiosity and problem-solving abilities, I am looking forward to continuing to hone my eye for detail, as these will be invaluable in interpreting data and gaining insights that can drive business decisions.</p>
                
            <p>I am looking forward to working in a company and/or industry where we can use data to help the community be able to make more informed decisions about issues that are important to them.</p>
